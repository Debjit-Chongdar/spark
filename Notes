1. each action will create execution plan from action point to start
2. if any shuffle happened between action & start, then it will skip previous stage of suffle (It will be shown in DAG as skipped)
3. -> each action create a new job
4. -> each shuffle between partition, creates a new stage
5. -> each transformation creates a new task
6. Action => reduce(Fn),collect(),count(), take(5), first(), save(), foreach, explain(), (sortByKey(true))
7. Shuffle => reduceByKey(Fn),groupByKey(),sortByKey(false),repartition(6),coalesce(2)
8. Transformation => map(Fn), mapToPair(PairFn), flatMap(Iterator),
9. Join is possible only on JavaPairRdd(key)   # -> return JavaPairRDD<key, Tuple2(1st_val, 2nd_val)>
10. jsc.parallelize() / jsc.textFIle()

11. sortAggregation is slower than hashAggregation, (HashAggregate is more faster with JavaAPI instead sql on temp table)
            hashAggregation apply if sortBy column is part of groupBy columns
        or  if it's not part of groupBy column but it's mutable type like Integer, Long, Double, Short, etc
                where size is fixed like 32 bit for Integer, 64 bit for Long, not varargs like String.
12. batchInterval (Must be) ≤ windowDuration, windowDuration (Must be) ≥ batchInterval,
        slideDuration Usually equals batchInterval, or a divisor of it
