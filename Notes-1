🔥 What WOULD Bring Data to the Driver?
    -> collect() , take() , first()
    -> show()   // partially
    -> count()  // only returns a number
 ** write file after transformation is done by Executor, not bring back to Driver

🚨 When Driver Crashes
    -> 1️⃣ Using collect() -> If dataset is huge -> Entire data is sent to driver -> Driver OOM -> Job Crashes
    -> 3️⃣ Large Broadcast Variable -> Driver first collects it, then distribute -> Driver OOM possible

🔹 Case 1: Input Data > Executor Memory
    This is common and usually handled gracefully by Spark.
    ✅ What Spark Does
        Spark does not load entire dataset into memory at once. It Splits data into partitions
        Processes one partition at a time per executor
    Uses:
        Memory & Disk spill (if memory is insufficient)

🔥 If Memory Is Not Enough
1️⃣ Spill to Disk
        For operations like:
    -> Shuffle / Sort / Join / Aggregation
    -> Spark spills intermediate data to disk automatically.

2️⃣ OutOfMemoryError (Executor OOM)
    -> A single partition is too large
    -> Data skew
    -> Huge collect inside transformation
    -> Broadcast table too big

🔹 Schema Evolution:
    Schema evolution is the ability of a data system to handle changes in the structure (schema)
    of data over time without breaking existing pipelines or queries.
    🔹 Types of Schema Changes
        ✅ 1. Add Column (Most Common) :  Add new nullable column.
        ✅ 2. Remove Column :  May hide column (physical deletion depends on format).
        ✅ 3. Rename Column :  Supported in advanced table formats like Delta.
        ✅ 4. Change Data Type :  Limited support (e.g., INT → LONG may work).
    spark.read.option("mergeSchema", "true").parquet("users")
    df.write.format("delta").option("mergeSchema", "true").mode("append").save("users_delta")

🔹 Narrow Transformation vs Wide Transformation
    -> map() , filter() , flatMap() , mapPartitions() , union()
    -> groupByKey() , reduceByKey() , distinct() , join() , repartition() , sortByKey()
